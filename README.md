# ChessAI

* This project as the goal of create a playable Chess game against a trained RL agent that can play chess at a hight level of proficiency, capable of evaluation chess positions and making strategic decisions.

## Objectives

* Optimize decision-making using RL algorithms: Explore different RL algorithms, as seen in class, to
train the agent. Compare and analyse their effectiveness in learning and decision-making
capabilities in the context of chess.
* Use a challenging chess environment: Use a comprehensive environment for the agent to interact
with, representing the rules and dynamics of chess. This environment will provide a realistic and
challenging setting for the agent's training and evaluation.
* Evaluate and benchmark performance: Assess the performance of the RL agent against different
benchmarks from an existing chess engine (Stockfish). 

## Extra Objectives:
* Investigate transfer learning and generalization: Explore techniques for transfer learning to
leverage knowledge acquired in related domains or from pre-training on large chess datasets.
Investigate the agent's ability to generalize its knowledge.
* Enhance interpretability and analysis: Develop methods to analyse the agent's decision-making
process and provide insights into its strategic thinking. Investigate techniques to visualize the
agent's evaluation of chess positions and understand its reasoning behind specific moves.
